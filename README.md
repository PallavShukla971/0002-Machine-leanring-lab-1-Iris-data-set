# Machine-leanring-lab-1-Iris-data-set
Hi there, this repository is for all the basics used in Swansea university assignments for learning python in data science. It has some uses over IRIS data set as well.
I am uploading all the files of machine learning, at Swansea University.
Some use of linear equations, how to use f-string, introduction to the iris data set, and how to apply data pre processing on IRIS Dataset.
-> Some simple multiplication
-> hello world 
-> defining a fucntion
-> using numbers by assigning it to variables and then applying operations
-> 
-> Declaring a list and using the names in it.
-> Printing all the elements using a loop and printing as element-wise. 
-> Comparing the values in a variable, and if it matches then print.
-> Decalred the dictionary and then added the values.
-> print the number of elements in each dictionary

-> how to pick elements one by one from the dictionary.
-> use of the f-string function, and then use it for the element name and a number of the elements.

-> Task 1.3 )
-> Numpy as np
-> Application use of random function and random int function 
->  then print the digits until 4th digit is repeated back again.

-> 1.3.3
-> Print multiplication in the same format by using a variable. 
-> print the first element of the array in first row and second row.
-> 
-> 1.4.1
->  load a data set in this case we are using iris data set.
->  print the demographics of the sheet like max and min
-> draw a scatter plot of the data set given here Iris data set
-> imported matplotlib. 
-> use the scatter fucntion and then use xlabel and ylabel
-> use petal length and petal width.
-> then displaying the scattered plot.
